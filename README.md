# Academic Integration Project: Spring, Angular & Data Mining

This repository contains the Academic Integration Project that combines Spring Boot, Angular, and Data Mining techniques to demonstrate a full-stack application with a focus on extracting valuable information from datasets.

## Project Overview

The project aims to showcase an end-to-end data-driven application where the backend is powered by Spring Boot, serving a RESTful API that interacts with a front-end application developed in Angular. Data Mining algorithms are applied to process and analyze data, extracting meaningful patterns and insights.

### Features

- RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.
- Integration with Angular for a seamless front-end experience.
- Implementation of various Data Mining algorithms.
- Interactive visualizations of data insights.
